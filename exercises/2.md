# 2. Install Confluent Platform

Confluent for Kubernetes includes CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) for each Confluent Platform component service.

## Install Confluent Platform

You'll install Confluent Platform in a single node configuration. This single node configuration is expressed in a declarative spec YAML.

```
# Take a look at the declarative spec YAML
vi /home/ubuntu/code/cfk-workshop/dev/confluent-platform-minikube.yaml

# Deploy the yaml
kubectl apply -f /home/ubuntu/code/cfk-workshop/dev/confluent-platform-minikube.yaml -n confluent

# Open up another terminal tab, and watch the pods come up
watch kubectl get pods
```

Since this is a single node development environment, the Confluent component pods will come up one after the other, in order of dependency. You'll see Zookeeper come up first, then Kafka, then the other component services.

Confluent for Kubernetes includes a kubectl plugin, that you can use to get information on your deployment.

```
# Check out the plugin CLI commands
kubectl confluent
# Look at the status of all services
kubectl confluent status -n confluent
# Check what versions have been installed. The latest Confluent Platform release is 6.2.0.
kubectl confluent version -n confluent
```
