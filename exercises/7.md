# 7. Build and re-deploy Spring KStreams app

There's an issue in the word count app - it counts individual letters and counts them, not just words. Let's fix that!

The steps to this exercise are:

- Update the Wordcount code

- Re-build the jar and Docker image

- Push to your Docker repository

- Make your own Github repository and hook up to ArgoCD

- Push the wordcount yamls to your github repository


## Update the Wordcount code

The source code to this Spring Boot app is at 

```
cd /home/ubuntu/code/cfk-workshop/apps/wordcount/src/main/java/io/confluent/developer/datagen
vi WordcountApplication.java
```

In that source code file, in the WordcountApplication::Function code, uncomment the line so that only words greater than 3 characters are counted.

Save the file.

## Re-build the jar and Docker image

Build the application

```
# Use gradle wrapper to build
./gradlew clean assemble -x test --build-cache --quiet

# See the build output
ls /home/ubuntu/code/cfk-workshop/apps/wordcount/build/libs
```

Build the application as a Docker image.

Log in to your Docker account:

```
docker login
Username: ...
Password: ***
```

```
# Build the Docker image locally (on this development machine)
./gradlew bootBuildImage --imageName=docker.io/<your_docker_id>/wordcount

# Push the Docker image to Docker hub
docker push

# View the images in local Docker
docker images
REPOSITORY TAG
<your_docker_id>/datagen                    latest
```

## Make your own Github repository and hook up to ArgoCD

Fork the repository https://github.com/confluentinc/cfk-workshop to your own Github repo.

If you haven't already set this up, follow the steps in the above Lab #6 to set up ArgoCD.

Add a new application, using the same settings as from Lab #6 except for setting the Github repo URL to `https://github.com/<your-docker-account>/cfk-workshop.git`


## Push the wordcount yamls to your github repository

Clone that forked repo onto the lab VM.

Update the deployment yaml to use your docker images.

```
cd /home/ubuntu/code/cfk-workshop/apps
vi wordcount-app-deployment.yaml
...
       image: docker.io/rohit2b/wordcount
# Change this to
       image: docker.io/<your-dockerhub-repo>/wordcount
```

Add the deployment yaml files for the wordcount application to your forked repo:

```
cp /home/ubuntu/code/cfk-workshop/apps/wordcount-app-deployment.yaml  <path-to-your-forked-repo>/gitops-dev/
cp /home/ubuntu/code/cfk-workshop/apps/wordcount-app-secret.yaml  <path-to-your-forked-repo>/gitops-dev/
```

Check in the code updates and push to your forked Git repo. You should now see the wordcount app deployed.


Once this is complete, you should see the wordcount app deployed to the minikube!
