# 1. Install Confluent for Kubernetes

## Kubernetes concepts

Kubernetes supports multiple virtual clusters backed by the same physical cluster. These virtual clusters are called namespaces. Namespaces provide a scope for names. Names of resources need to be unique within a namespace, but not across namespaces. Namespaces cannot be nested inside one another and each Kubernetes resource can only be in one namespace.

The Kubernetes command-line tool, kubectl, allows you to run commands against Kubernetes clusters. You can use kubectl to deploy applications, inspect and manage cluster resources, and view logs.

A custom resource is an extension of the Kubernetes API that is not necessarily available in a default Kubernetes installation. It represents a customization of a particular Kubernetes installation. Once a custom resource is installed, users can create and access its objects using kubectl, just as they do for built-in resources like Pods.


## Minikube for development environment

Minikube is local Kubernetes, focusing on making it easy to learn and develop for Kubernetes. Minikube can be installed and run on your laptop. 

In this exercise, you'll install a functionally complete Confluent Platform on Minikube.

Minikube has already been installed on this lab environment. Confluent for Kubernetes supports Kubernetes version 1.20. 

Start the minikube cluster, using Kubernetes version 1.20:

```
minikube start --kubernetes-version=v1.20.9
```

Check that Minikube starts successfully by viewing status:

```
minikube status
```


## Install Confluent for Kubernetes Operator

Now that Minikube is up and running, we'll install the Confluent for Kubernetes (CFK) Operator. We'll install it in a specific namespace - "confluent".

```
# Create namespace to use
kubectl create ns confluent

# Set namespace for current context to `confluent`. With this in place, all subsequent kubectl commands will assume that the namespace to use is `confluent`
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace confluent

# Check your kubectl context
kubectl config get-contexts

# Add the Confluent Helm repository. Helm is used to package the Confluent for Kubernetes(CFK) Operator and CRDs.
helm repo add confluentinc https://packages.confluent.io/helm

# Install CFK Operator
helm install cfk-operator confluentinc/confluent-for-kubernetes -n confluent

# Once install is successful, you'll see the installed chart
helm list -n confluent
NAME          NAMESPACE  REVISION  STATUS    CHART                              APP VERSION
cfk-operator  confluent  1         updated     confluent-for-kubernetes-0.174  2.0.2

# The Helm chart deploys the Confluent for Kubernetes  (CFK) Operator as a pod. You should see it up and running.
kubectl get pods -n confluent
NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
confluent-operator-66bcf88444-vd5gg   1/1     Running   0          14h
```

You should also now have the Confluent CRDs installed.

```
kubectl get crds
NAME                                          CREATED AT

```

As we discussed in the concepts section, a  CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) resource allows you to define custom resources.

Confluent for Kubernetes includes a CRD for each Confluent Platform component, as well as a CRD for Topics and Confluent Role Based Access Control rolebindings.
